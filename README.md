For this guide, we will be creating a simple product display of a Chec storefront using [Commerce.js](https://commercejs.com/) SDK and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as a framework. 

What is Commerce.js you might ask? If this is your first foray into a Headless eCommerce project, please continue to read on! Another question might then be "What is headless eCommerce?" There are definitely a lot of sources out there explaining what exactly this "headless" concept means. When I first started my career at [Commerce.js](https://commercejs.com/), I did my fair share of digging and wrote up a [TL;DR](https://dev.to/jaepass/what-is-headless-ecommerce-3nfb).

So now what is Commerce.js? Commerce.js is an API-first eCommerce solution platform aimed at creating seamless eCommerce solution integrated with modern tools. As this was my first foray into creating a headless eCommerce solution as a new developer, being able to jump right in an spit out a scaffold of an eCommerce app with Commerce.js made me feel powerful as a relatively new developer.
